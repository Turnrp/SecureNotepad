# SecureNotepad

**Note**: I cannot confirm this is fully secure yet. If anyone is up for the challenge to attempt and breach an account, go for it. But remember this would be breached once compiled into ".exe" and with proper locations for the user and note files.

To create a user, follow these steps:
1. Press the "Create User" Button.
2. Type in a Username and Password.
3. Enter the credentials into the login page.
4. Now you have your secure notes!
