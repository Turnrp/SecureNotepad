# SecureNotepad
This is a application created for encrypting data from a notepad-like application.  <br />
 <br />
*Note:* I hope that this is fully secure if anyone can make it more secure pull requests are welcome, or, if you just have an idea you can use the Issues tab. <br />

To create a user, follow these steps:
1. Press the "Create User" Button.
2. Type in a Username and Password.
3. Enter the credentials into the login page.
4. Now you have your secure notes!

**What It Looks Like:** <br />
